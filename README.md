Owncloud-re/Design
==================
*A personnal vision of what Owncloud should be...*

> I’m using a private cloud storage every day, in my personal and
> professional life. Recent events have made me react, I want an
> efficient cloud service that respects my privacy too.
> 
> The holiday period in France giving me some free time (and because i
> didn’t want to create another ios7 re/design concept…), i took a few
> nights off from my job as a freelancer, to work on a concept for
> owncloud.
> 
> This is a personal version who doesn’t care about customer
> requirements, budget or timetable, I do not care either about
> technical constraints and think the product for modern browsers only.
> It’s one of opportunities of the designer, I took advantage of it.
